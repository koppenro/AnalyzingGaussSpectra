=====================================
**Documentation**

This documentation gives a short description of the functionality of the program "MakeTxt.cc".
For details please take a look in the code. 

The program copies the slopes of energy calibration lines from several modules in a single file which can be analyzed by e.g. "HistoCalibrationSlopes.cc". 
The directory, where the data of the modules is saved, has to be given in the file "MakeTxt-Config.config". 
The output files are named "Slopes-CalibrationLines-SingleGauss.txt" and "Slopes-CalibrationLines-MoReWeb.txt".
