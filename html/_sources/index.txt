**C++/ROOT programs to analyze Xray spectra and do the energy calibration: EKP, KIT**
=====================================
**Documentation**

This documentation gives a short description of the programs used to analyze Xray spectra and doing the energy calibration of digital readout chips. 
FitGaussDistribution.cc is used to find the peak position of Xray spectra with two different algorithms. 
CalibrationLine-ErrorBars.cc plots the peak positions against the expected number of electrons of the targets and performs a linear fit for energy calibration. 
CurrentDependency.cc plots the peak positions against the used currents of the Xray tube and performs a linear fit to check the rate dependency of the read out chip.
