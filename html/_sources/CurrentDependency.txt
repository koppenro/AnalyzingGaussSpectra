**CurrentDependency**
=====================================
**Documentation**

This documentation gives a short description of the functionality of the program "CurrentDependency.cc".
For details please take a look in the code. 

This program plots the peak positions of Xray spectra against the used currents of the Xray tube.
The outputfiles from FitGaussDistribution.cc are saved in the subdirectory "results" 
Options are:
   * -temp $temperature: set temperature to $temperature, standard is "p20"
   * -m: Xray spectra are measured with a module (results from all ROCs will be analyzed)
   * -roc $ROCnumber: only results from ROC $ROCnumber will be analyzed
   * -l $legendtitle: set legendtitle, standard is empty

In the main program a linear fit is done and the slopes are saved. Results are saved as .png, .pdf and .txt

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

.. function:: findTargetPlace(current, availableCurrents)

   Return a characteristic integer for each target used in the Xray spectra to fill the data at the right position in an array
   
   :param current: Used source in the xray spectrum
   :param availableCurrents: TString of all used Currents
   :return: i (int)
	
.. function:: readin(data_x, data_y, availableTargets, txt)

   Read in data from files produced by FitGaussDistribution.cc.

   :param data_x: array for currents
   :param data_y: array for peak positions
   :param availableTargets: all used targets in the spectra
   :param txt: name of outputfile from FitGaussDistribution.cc
   :return: void

.. function:: PlotGraph(data_x, data_y, n , availableTargets, legtitle, outputtxt, ylimitup, ylimitdown, outputpdf)

   Plot the peak positions against the currents. 
   Perform a linear fit. 
   Results saved as .txt, .png and .pdf

   :param data_x: array for currents
   :param data_y: array for peak positions
   :param n: number of different targets
   :param availableTargets: array of used targets
   :param legtitle: title of legend
   :param outputtxt: title of outputfile in which the slopes are saved
   :param ylimitup: maximum of y axis scale
   :param ylimitdown: minimum of y axis scale
   :param outputpdf: title of outputfile .pdf
   
   :return: void
