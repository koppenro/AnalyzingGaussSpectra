**CalibrationLine-ErrorBars**
=====================================
**Documentation**

This documentation gives a short description of the functionality of the program "CalibrationLine-ErrorBars.cc".
For details please take a look in the code. 

The program will plot the peak positions of Xray spectra against the expected number of electrons produced in the silicon sensor. 
Options are:
   * -m: Xray spectra are measured with a module (results from all ROCs will be analyzed)
   * -roc $ROCnumber: only results from ROC $ROCnumber will be analyzed
   * -l $legendtitle: set legendtitle, standard is empty
A linear fit is used and the slope are saved. 
Results are saved as .png, .pdf and .txt

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

.. function:: erroronElectrons(actualSource)

   Return the error on the expected number of electrons produced in a silicon sensor. 
   Data taken from NIST. 
   
   :param actualSource: Used source in the xray spectrum
   :return: yerror (double)
	
.. function:: findCurrentPlace(current, availableCurrents)

   Return a characteristic integer for each used current to fill the data at the right position in an array

   :param current: current of the actual spectrum
   :param availableCurrents: integer array with all used currents
   :return: i (int)

.. function:: readin(data_x, data_y, data_xerr, data_yerr, availableCurrents, txt, MoReWeb)

   Read in data from files produced by FitGaussDistribution.cc.

   :param data_x: array for peak positions
   :param data_y: array for number of electrons produced in silicon sensor
   :param data_xerr: error on peak positions. For Single Gaussian 1.5, for MoReWeb 1.2, set in this function
   :param data_yerr: error on number of electrons
   :return: void

.. function:: PlotGraph(data_x, data_y, data_xerr, data_yerr, n , availableCurrents, legtitle, outputtxt, outputpdf, chipnr)

   Plot the peak positions against the number of electrons with x and y error bars. 
   Perform a linear fit. 
   Results saved as .txt, .png and .pdf

   :param data_x: array for peak positions
   :param data_y: array for number of electrons produced in silicon sensor
   :param data_xerr: error on peak positions
   :param data_yerr: error on number of electrons
   
   :return: void
